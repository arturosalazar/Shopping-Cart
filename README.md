# Shopping-Cart

A program to create a "store" with items that a user can add to their shopping cart/check out. This program is a workbook challenge, so has limited functionality

# Goal of Project
This project is for me to practice using all of the materials I have learned thus far from the the Complete Java Development Bootcamp on Udemy. Some tasks include - handling checked exceptions, throwing unchecked exceptions, reading/loading data from files, and making a program "bulletproof" (ensuring the program won't crash regardless of input from the user).

# Project source
This challenge/program is from the Complete Java Development Bootcamp on Udemy https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-java-development-bootcamp/
The course provided the skeleton for the program (class names and a main signature) as well as a products.txt file to use with reading data. Some formatting for the Store class was provided by the course along with inventory data. There were also some commented prompts and hints for type of methods to create in the main class. The rest of the code is mine
